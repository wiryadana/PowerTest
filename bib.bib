	abstract = {Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) is unique among the rheumatic diseases because it presents the challenge of managing a chronic multisystem autoimmune disease with a widespread obliterative vasculopathy of small arteries that is associated with varying degrees of tissue fibrosis. The hallmark of scleroderma is clinical heterogeneity with subsets that vary in the degree of disease expression, organ involvement, and ultimate prognosis. Thus, the term scleroderma is used to describe patients who have common manifestations that link them together, whereas a highly variable clinical course exists that spans from mild and subtle findings to aggressive, life-threatening multisystem disease. The physician needs to carefully characterize each patient to understand the specific manifestations and level of disease activity to decide appropriate treatment. This is particularly important in treating a patient with scleroderma because there is no treatment that has been proven to modify the overall disease course, although therapy that targets specific organ involvement early before irreversible damage occurs improves both quality of life and survival. This review describes our approach as defined by evidence, expert opinion, and our experience treating patients. Scleroderma is a multisystem disease with variable expression; thus, any treatment plan must be holistic, yet at the same time focus on the dominant organ disease. The goal of therapy is to improve quality of life by minimizing specific organ involvement and subsequent life-threatening disease. At the same time the many factors that alter daily function need to be addressed, including nutrition, pain, deconditioning, musculoskeletal disuse, comorbid conditions, and the emotional aspects of the disease, such as fear, depression, and the social withdrawal caused by disfigurement.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sensitive and specific criteria for the classification of systemic sclerosis are required by clinicians and investigators to achieve higher quality clinical studies and approaches to therapy. A clinical study of systemic sclerosis patients in Europe and Canada led to a set of criteria that achieve high sensitivity and specificity.
MATERIAL/METHODS: Both clinical and laboratory investigations of patients with systemic sclerosis, related conditions and diseases with clinical features that can be mistaken as part of the systemic sclerosis spectrum were undertaken. Laboratory investigations included the detection of autoantibodies to centromere proteins, Scl-70 (topoisomerase I), and fibrillarin (U3-RNP).
RESULTS: Based on the investigation of 269 systemic sclerosis patients and 720 patients presenting with related and confounding conditions, the following set of criteria for the classification of systemic sclerosis was proposed: 1) autoantibodies to: centromere proteins, Scl-70 (topo I), fibrillarin; 2) bibasilar pulmonary fibrosis; 3) contractures of the digital joints or prayer sign; 4) dermal thickening proximal to the wrists; 5) calcinosis cutis; 6) Raynaud's phenomenon; 7) esophageal distal hypomotility or reflux-esophagitis; 8) sclerodactyly or non-pitting digital edema; 9) teleangiectasias. The classification of definite SSc requires at least three of the above criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: Criteria for the classification of systemic sclerosis have been proposed. Preliminary testing has defined the sensitivity and specificity of these criteria as high as 99\% and 100\%, respectively. Testing and validation of the proposed criteria by other clinical centers is required.},

	abstract = {Background
Diabetic foot ulceration is a serious limb-threatening complication of diabetes. It is the common cause of hospital admissions and amputations., The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and its association with age, gender, duration of diabetes, peripheral neuropathy (PN), peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and HbA1c.

Methods
A total of 1940 people (≥ 30 years of age) with type 2 diabetes coming to the Sakina Institute of Diabetes and Endocrine Research (specialist diabetes clinic) at Shalamar Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, were recruited over a period of 1 year from January 2016 to January 2017. The foot ulcers were identified according to the University of Texas classification. PN was assessed by biothesiometer and PAD by ankle-brachial index ({\textless} 0.9). Body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), HbA1c and duration of diabetes were recorded.

Results
The prevalence of DFU was 7.02\%, of which 4.5\% of the ulcers were on the planter and 2.6\% on the dorsal surface of the foot; 8.5\% of the persons had bilateral foot ulcers and 0.4\% subjects had Charcot deformity. There was significant association of foot ulcers with age, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, PN and PAD, whereas no association was observed with gender and BMI. PN and PAD were observed in 26.3 and 6.68\% of people with diabetes respectively. Neuropathic ulcers and neuro-ischemic ulcers were identified in 74 and 19\% of the study population. Logistic regression analysis revealed significant odds ratio for peripheral neuropathy 23.9 (95\% confidence interval (5.41–105.6).

Conclusions
Peripheral neuropathy is the commonest cause of foot ulcers. An optimum control of blood glucose to prevent neuropathy and regular feet examination of every person with diabetes may go a long way in preventing foot ulceration.},

It is intended as a guide for the use of antimicrobial agents in managing patients with cancer who experience chemotherapy-induced fever and neutropenia.Recent advances in antimicrobial drug development and technology, clinical trial results, and extensive clinical experience have informed the approaches and recommendations herein. Because the previous iteration of this guideline in 2002, we have a developed a clearer definition of which populations of patients with cancer may benefit most from antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral prophylaxis. Furthermore, categorizing neutropenic patients as being at high risk or low risk for infection according to presenting signs and symptoms, underlying cancer, type of therapy, and medical comorbidities has become essential to the treatment algorithm. Risk stratification is a recommended starting point for managing patients with fever and neutropenia. In addition, earlier detection of invasive fungal infections has led to debate regarding optimal use of empirical or preemptive antifungal therapy, although algorithms are still evolving.What has not changed is the indication for immediate empirical antibiotic therapy. It remains true that all patients who present with fever and neutropenia should be treated swiftly and broadly with antibiotics to treat both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.Finally, we note that all Panel members are from institutions in the United States or Canada; thus, these guidelines were developed in the context of North American practices. Some recommendations may not be as applicable outside of North America, in areas where differences in available antibiotics, in the predominant pathogens, and/or in health care–associated economic conditions exist. Regardless of venue, clinical vigilance and immediate treatment are the universal keys to managing neutropenic patients with fever and/or infection.},

To evaluate the febrile neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies hospitalized in hematology clinic with poor hygiene standards.
Methods
A total of 124 patients with hematological malignancies (69 male, 55 female) hospitalized in hematology clinic with poor hygiene conditions depending on hospital conditions, between January 2007 and December 2010, were evaluated, retrospectively.
Results
In this study, 250 febrile neutropenia episodes developing in 124 hospitalized patients were evaluated. Of the patients, 69 were men (56\%) and 55 women (44\%). A total of 40 patients (32\%) had acute myeloid leukemia, 25 (20\%) acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 19 (15\%) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 10 (8\%) multiple myeloma, and 8 (8\%) chronic myeloid leukemia. In our study, 56 patients (22\%) were diagnosed as pneumonia, 38 (15\%) invasive aspergillosis, 38 (15\%) sepsis, 16 (6\%) typhlitis, 9 (4\%) mucormycosis, and 4 (2\%) urinary tract infection. Gram-positive cocci were isolated from 52\% (n = 20), while Gram-negative bacilli 42\% (n = 16) and yeasts from 6\% (n = 2) of the sepsis patients, respectively. The most frequently isolated Gram-positive bacteria were methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 18), while the most frequently isolated Gram-negative bacteria was Escherichia coli (n = 10).
Conclusions
Febrile neutropenia is still a problem in patients with hematological malignancies. The documentation of the flora and detection of causative agents of infections in each unit would help to decide appropriate empirical therapy. Infection control procedures should be applied for preventing infections and transmissions.},

	abstract = {Background:Various demographic, clinical and cytogenetic factors have been shown to affect the outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Some of these risk factors are well-described with performance status and patient age being principal predictors of early death while cytogenetic and molecular factors allow stratification into prognostic categories. However, several critical factors have not been adequately assessed. Typically AML patients treated with standard induction chemotherapy will have cytopenias requiring intervention. Often the neutropenia is prolonged and results in neutropenic fevers and a high risk of infections. We hereby describe a single institution retrospective analysis at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) in which we evaluate the effect of duration of days with at risk absolute neutrophil (ANC) and absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) and the occurrence of neutropenic fever on survival and response rates of AML patients.Methods:This is a retrospective chart review of AML adult patients who were diagnosed and treated at OUHSC between 2000 and 2014 and were undergoing initial induction chemotherapy. Outcomes of interest were overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS: in case of relapse or death) and complete response (CR). Variables of interest wereneutropenic fever, and duration of decreased ANC and ALC counts (ANC\&lt;500, ANC\&lt;100, ALC\&lt;500, ALC\&lt;100). Institution policy did not allow granulocytes colony stimulating factors use because of the interference with bone marrow aspirate results. Nonetheless it was rarely used in few cases of septic shock, so this variable was not included in this analysis. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the variables of interest and the outcomes.Models were used to assess the relationship between the variables of neutropenic fever, duration of decreased counts (ANC\&lt;500, ANC\&lt;100, ALC\&lt;500, ALC\&lt;100) and the outcome of interest after adjusting for age, race, gender, risk group andwhite blood count (WBC). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used for OS and EFS and multivariable logistic regression models were used for CR. SAS 9.4 was used for all analyses. An alpha of 0.05 was used.Results:A total of 153 patients were analyzed. Mean age was 50 years, 35.7 \% female, 64.3\% male. Based on cytogenetics 16.9\% were in favorable category, 28.6\% in intermediate, 25.3\% in unfavorable risk group, and 29.2\% unknown. Mean number of weeks with ANC \&lt;500 was 3.58 (25 days), ANC \&lt;100 was 2.81 (20 days), ALC \&lt; 500 was 4.47 (31 days), ANC \&lt;100 was 3.24 (23 days). Incidence of neutropenic fever was 86.9\%. Total number of positive cultures was 55.2\%, of which 78.3\% were bacterial, 25.3\% fungal and 7.7\% viral.After adjustment for age, race, gender, WBC and risk group, both neutropenic fever and duration during which ANC \&lt; 100 were associated with worse OS (p value \&lt;0.05) while duration of ANC\&lt; 500 was not significant (p value \&lt; 0.0576). When we considered EFS, the duration where ANC\&lt;500, ANC \&lt;100, and neutropenic fever occurrence were significant (p value \&lt;0.05).The hazard ratio of death is 3.15 for those with neutropenic fever compared to those without.With regard to CR, duration of ANC \&lt; 100 was significant (p value 0.0272). The duration of ALC \&lt;500 or \&lt;100 was not significant for OS nor EFS. Examining duration of neutropenia, for every week with ANC \&lt;500, there was a 9\% higher hazard ratio of death after adjusting for other covariates.Conclusion:In this single-institution, retrospective study, we identified that the duration of neutropenia along with the presence of neutropenic fever during induction therapy adversely affected OS and EFS.

	abstract = {Background
The aim of the study was to elaborate a predictive model for the duration of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) allowing the identification of patients with a higher risk of complications, especially complicated febrile neutropenia, who might benefit from preventive measures.
Patients and methods
A score ranging from 0 to 4 on the basis of expected CIN was attributed to each cytotoxic agent given as part of chemotherapy treatment in solid tumours for patients with febrile neutropenia (FN). The individual scores were combined into several overall scores.
Results
A total of 203 patients with FN were eligible for this retrospective analysis. We were able to identify two groups of patients with statistically different neutropenia durations with median durations until hematological recovery of ANC ≥0.5 and ≥1.0 × 109/l, being respectively 6 versus 4 days (P = 0.03) and 8 versus 6 days (P = 0.01).
Conclusions
The duration of neutropenia is directly influenced by the aggressiveness of the chemotherapy regimen. In this retrospective study, we were able to identify a group of patients who needed two more additional days to recover from grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia, based on the degree of aggressiveness of the cytotoxic agents used.},

	abstract = {Background:Various demographic, clinical and cytogenetic factors have been shown to affect the outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Some of these risk factors are well-described with performance status and patient age being principal predictors of early death while cytogenetic and molecular factors allow stratification into prognostic categories. However, several critical factors have not been adequately assessed. Typically AML patients treated with standard induction chemotherapy will have cytopenias requiring intervention. Often the neutropenia is prolonged and results in neutropenic fevers and a high risk of infections. We hereby describe a single institution retrospective analysis at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) in which we evaluate the effect of duration of days with at risk absolute neutrophil (ANC) and absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) and the occurrence of neutropenic fever on survival and response rates of AML patients.Methods:This is a retrospective chart review of AML adult patients who were diagnosed and treated at OUHSC between 2000 and 2014 and were undergoing initial induction chemotherapy. Outcomes of interest were overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS: in case of relapse or death) and complete response (CR). Variables of interest wereneutropenic fever, and duration of decreased ANC and ALC counts (ANC\&lt;500, ANC\&lt;100, ALC\&lt;500, ALC\&lt;100). Institution policy did not allow granulocytes colony stimulating factors use because of the interference with bone marrow aspirate results. Nonetheless it was rarely used in few cases of septic shock, so this variable was not included in this analysis. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the variables of interest and the outcomes.Models were used to assess the relationship between the variables of neutropenic fever, duration of decreased counts (ANC\&lt;500, ANC\&lt;100, ALC\&lt;500, ALC\&lt;100) and the outcome of interest after adjusting for age, race, gender, risk group andwhite blood count (WBC). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used for OS and EFS and multivariable logistic regression models were used for CR. SAS 9.4 was used for all analyses. An alpha of 0.05 was used.Results:A total of 153 patients were analyzed. Mean age was 50 years, 35.7 \% female, 64.3\% male. Based on cytogenetics 16.9\% were in favorable category, 28.6\% in intermediate, 25.3\% in unfavorable risk group, and 29.2\% unknown. Mean number of weeks with ANC \&lt;500 was 3.58 (25 days), ANC \&lt;100 was 2.81 (20 days), ALC \&lt; 500 was 4.47 (31 days), ANC \&lt;100 was 3.24 (23 days). Incidence of neutropenic fever was 86.9\%. Total number of positive cultures was 55.2\%, of which 78.3\% were bacterial, 25.3\% fungal and 7.7\% viral.After adjustment for age, race, gender, WBC and risk group, both neutropenic fever and duration during which ANC \&lt; 100 were associated with worse OS (p value \&lt;0.05) while duration of ANC\&lt; 500 was not significant (p value \&lt; 0.0576). When we considered EFS, the duration where ANC\&lt;500, ANC \&lt;100, and neutropenic fever occurrence were significant (p value \&lt;0.05).The hazard ratio of death is 3.15 for those with neutropenic fever compared to those without.With regard to CR, duration of ANC \&lt; 100 was significant (p value 0.0272). The duration of ALC \&lt;500 or \&lt;100 was not significant for OS nor EFS. Examining duration of neutropenia, for every week with ANC \&lt;500, there was a 9\% higher hazard ratio of death after adjusting for other covariates.Conclusion:In this single-institution, retrospective study, we identified that the duration of neutropenia along with the presence of neutropenic fever during induction therapy adversely affected OS and EFS. Shorter duration of neutropenia significantly correlated with CR. Duration of days with ALC count \&lt;500 was not predictive of OS nor EFS. Larger studies are needed to examine the prognostic significance of neutropenia duration and its relationship to OS and CR. Neutropenia duration during induction chemotherapy may be an important risk factor in making decisions regarding future treatments including allogeneic transplant tolerability and aggressiveness of consolidation chemotherapy.It is important to look at this variable in more intensive induction regimens (using higher dose of cytarabine or adding a nucleoside analogue) as prolonged neutropenia may be a marker of poor general health rather than the induction regimen.Table 1Table 1.

Recipients of chemotherapy will often have a decreased ANC leading to an increased risk of infections specifically from bacterial sources. Neutropenia traditionally is risk stratified based on duration and depth of neutropenia. Recipients of chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and stem cell transplants (SCTs) often are deemed as having high risk neutropenia due to significant depth and duration of neutropenia. The mortality associated with febrile neutropenia is up to 11\%, and can be as high as 50\% in the setting of severe sepsis or septic shock. By risk stratifying neutropenia and the resultant neutropenic fever, the goal is to decrease the resultant morbidity and mortality (Taplitz et al., J Clin Oncol 36:3043–3054).},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of the biomarkers procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with febrile neutropenia (FN) undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia.

METHODS
We conducted a prospective, observational study in patients who developed FN while undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia. PCT and CRP were obtained in patients who presented with FN. Blood cultures also were obtained. The primary goals were to evaluate the ability of PCT and CRP to predict bacteremia in patients with FN. The secondary goals were to assess the prognostic role of PCT and CRP and to assess the microbiologic profile and culture sensitivity patterns in the study population.

RESULTS
A total of 124 episodes of FN that involved 67 patients with acute leukemia occurred in the study. PCT was superior to CRP in the prediction of bacteremia. The median PCT level in the bacteremia group was 3.25 ng/mL compared with 0.51 ng/mL in the group without bacteremia (P {\textless} .01). The median values of CRP in the bacteremia and without-bacteremia groups were 119.3 mg/L and 94.5 mg/L, respectively (P = .07). There were no differences in median PCT and CRP in patients who died and those who improved. Of the 42 positive cultures, Gram-negative bacteremia was common (86\%), and Escherichia coli was the most frequent organism isolated. Carbapenem resistance was seen in 39\% of positive cultures.

CONCLUSION
PCT is an effective biomarker to predict bacteremia in patients with FN undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia.},

In all, 100 patients were enrolled in the study. The CRP was determined in serum every 48 h from admission until resolution of the febrile episode. All patients presented with fever during the post-HCT neutropenic period. The febrile episodes were classified as microbiologically documented infection in 32 cases, clinically documented infection in 27 patients and fever of unknown origin in 41 patients. The mean CRP values on the first day of fever in these three groups were similar (NS). On the fifth day of antibiotic treatment, 50 patients remained pyrexial. Of these, 41 improved with modifications of antibiotherapy (mean CRP: 9.5 mg/dl; standard deviation (s.d.): 6.2) and nine died, five due to an infectious etiology (CRP: 21 mg/dl; s.d.: 4.4; P{\textless}0.003) and four from other causes (CRP: 11 mg/dl; s.d.: 3.4). On multivariate analysis, the CRP on the fifth day of treatment was an independent prognostic factor for fatal outcome.

	abstract = {C-reactive protein (CRP) was discovered by Tillett and Francis in 1930. The name CRP arose because it was first identified as a substance in the serum of patients with acute inflammation that reacted with the "c" carbohydrate antibody of the capsule of pneumococcus. CRP is a pentameric protein synthesized by the liver, whose level rises in response to inflammation. CRP is an acute-phase reactant protein that is primarily induced by the IL-6 action on the gene responsible for transcription of CRP during the acute phase of an inflammatory/infectious process. There is some question of whether dysregulation of the role of CRP in the clearance of apoptotic cells and cellular debris plays a role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but this has not been definitively demonstrated. It has been demonstrated to have some protective properties in animal studies on lung tissue in alveolitis by reducing neutrophil-mediated damage to the alveoli and protein leakage into the lung. CRP has both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties. It plays a role in the recognition and clearance of foreign pathogens and damaged cells by binding to the phosphocholine, phospholipids, histone, chromatin, and fibronectin. It can activate the classic complement pathway and also activates phagocytic cells via Fc receptors to expedite the removal of cellular debris and damaged or apoptotic cells and foreign pathogens. This can become pathologic, however, when it is activated by autoantibodies displaying the phosphocholine arm in auto-immune processes, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). It can also worsen tissue damage in certain cases by activation of the complement system and thus inflammatory cytokines.[1][2][3] As compared to the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which is an indirect test for inflammation, the levels of CRP rise and fall rapidly with the onset and removal of the inflammatory stimulus respectively. Persistently elevated CRP levels can be seen in chronic inflammatory conditions such as chronic infections or inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis. There are numerous causes of an elevated C-reactive protein.  These include acute and chronic conditions, and these can be infectious or non-infectious in etiology. However, markedly elevated levels of CRP are most often associated with an infectious cause[4] (an example of pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition).  Trauma can also cause elevations in CRP (alarmin response). More modest elevations tend to be associated with a broader spectrum of etiologies, ranging from sleep disturbances to periodontal disease.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of C-reactive protein (CRP) monitoring in the differential diagnosis and prognosis of febrile neutropenic episodes in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In all, 100 patients were enrolled in the study. The CRP was determined in serum every 48 h from admission until resolution of the febrile episode. All patients presented with fever during the post-HCT neutropenic period. The febrile episodes were classified as microbiologically documented infection in 32 cases, clinically documented infection in 27 patients and fever of unknown origin in 41 patients. The mean CRP values on the first day of fever in these three groups were similar (NS). On the fifth day of antibiotic treatment, 50 patients remained pyrexial. Of these, 41 improved with modifications of antibiotherapy (mean CRP: 9.5 mg/dl; standard deviation (s.d.): 6.2) and nine died, five due to an infectious etiology (CRP: 21 mg/dl; s.d.: 4.4; P{\textless}0.003) and four from other causes (CRP: 11 mg/dl; s.d.: 3.4). On multivariate analysis, the CRP on the fifth day of treatment was an independent prognostic factor for fatal outcome. We conclude that persistent elevation of the CRP is an independent factor predicting a fatal outcome in patients who remain febrile on the fifth day of antibiotherapy during neutropenic febrile episodes post-HCT.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Hospitalization for chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia is associated with substantial cost and may negatively impact clinical outcome due to associated dose attenuation. METHODS Medical records of 1355 patients with intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma receiving cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) or similar chemotherapy were reviewed. The potential risk factors associated with first hospitalization for febrile neutropenia were evaluated. RESULTS In the current study, 230 patients (17\%) experienced 1 or more hospitalizations for febrile neutropenia and greater than one-half of all initial hospitalizations for febrile neutropenia occurred in Cycles 1 or 2. Increased risk of hospitalization for febrile neutropenia, based on Cox proportional hazards models, was significantly associated with the following characteristics: age 65 years or older (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.79; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 1.35–2.37), serum albumin level at presentation less than or equal to 3.5 g/dL (HR = 1.34; 95\% CI, 1.01–1.78), planned average relative dose intensity greater than or equal to 80\% (HR = 2.70; 95\% CI, 1.47–4.98), baseline absolute neutrophil count less than 1500/mm3 (HR = 1.98; 95\% CI, 1.28–3.06), and the presence of hepatic disease (HR = 2.18; 95\% CI, 1.11–4.28). Lack of early granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in Cycles 1 and 2 was also associated with increased risk of hospitalization for febrile neutropenia, but this did not reach statistical significance. A composite risk score based on these potential risk factors effectively distinguished patients at greater risk of hospitalization for febrile neutropenia (P {\textless} 0.001), the majority of which were observed during the first cycle of chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS The data from the current study demonstrated that the risk of initial hospitalization for febrile neutropenia occured early in the course of CHOP-like chemotherapy. Identified risk factors for febrile neutropenia hospitalization may facilitate the use of targeted supportive care. Cancer 2003. © 2003 American Cancer Society.},

	abstract = {Purpose This study sought to evaluate factors associated with hospital length of stay in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia. Methods A prospective cohort study was performed at a single tertiary referral hospital in southern Brazil from October 2009 to August 2011. All adult cancer patients with febrile neutropenia admitted to the hematology ward were evaluated. Stepwise random-effects negative binomial regression was performed to identify risk factors for prolonged length of hospital stay. Results In total, 307 cases of febrile neutropenia were evaluated. The overall median length of hospital stay was 16 days (interquartile range 18 days). According to multiple negative binomial regression analysis, hematologic neoplasms (P = 0.003), high-dose chemotherapy regimens (P{\textless}0.001), duration of neutropenia (P{\textless}0.001), and bloodstream infection involving Gram-negative multi-drug-resistant bacteria (P = 0.003) were positively associated with prolonged hospital length of stay in patients with febrile neutropenia. The condition index showed no evidence of multi-collinearity effect among the independent variables. Conclusions Hematologic neoplasms, high-dose chemotherapy regimens, prolonged periods of neutropenia, and bloodstream infection with Gram-negative multi-drug-resistant bacteria are predictors of prolonged length hospital of stay among adult cancer patients with febrile neutropenia.},

	abstract = {Acute leukemias are a group of aggressive malignant diseases associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality. An important cause of both the latter is infectious complications. Patients with acute leukemia are highly susceptible to infectious diseases due to factors related to the disease itself, factors attributed to treatment, and specific individual risk factors in each patient. Patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia are at particularly high risk, and microbiological agents include viral, bacterial, and fungal agents. The etiology is often unknown in infectious complications, although adequate patient evaluation and sampling have diagnostic, prognostic and treatment-related consequences. Bacterial infections include a wide range of potential microbes, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive species, while fungal infections include both mold and yeast. A recurring problem is increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents, and in particular, this applies to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance (ESBL), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and even carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). International guidelines for the treatment of sepsis in leukemia patients include the use of broad-spectrum Pseudomonas-acting antibiotics. However, one should implant the knowledge of local microbiological epidemiology and resistance conditions in treatment decisions. In this review, we discuss infectious diseases in acute leukemia with a major focus on febrile neutropenia and sepsis, and we problematize the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic aspects of infectious complications in this patient group. Meticulously and thorough clinical and radiological examination combined with adequate microbiology samples are cornerstones of the examination. Diagnostic and prognostic evaluation includes patient review according to the multinational association for supportive care in cancer (MASCC) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scoring system. Antimicrobial treatments for important etiological agents are presented. The main challenge for reducing the spread of resistant microbes is to avoid unnecessary antibiotic treatment, but without giving to narrow treatment to the febrile neutropenic patient that reduce the prognosis.},

	abstract = {Smoking has been postulated as an environmental risk factor for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The primary objective of this meta-analysis of observational studies was to evaluate the epidemiologic relationship between smoking and the risk of development of AML. Twenty-three studies published between January 1993 and December 2013 were included in our analysis, and accounted for 7,746 cases of AML. The outcome of interest was the relative risk (RR) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) of developing AML in adult cigarette smokers in comparison with non-smokers, and was estimated using the random-effects model. Our results showed that current and ever smokers have 40\% (RR 1.40, 95\% CI 1.22-1.60; P {\textless} 0.001) and 25\% (RR 1.25, 95\% CI 1.15-1.36; P {\textless} 0.001) increased risk of developing AML when compared with non-smokers. The increased RR of AML was increased regardless of sex, study design, geographical region, and quality of the studies. Intensity of smoking of {\textless}10, 10-20, 20-30, and {\textgreater}30 cigarettes per day was associated with RRs of AML of 1.27, 1.36, 1.55, and 1.77, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001 for trend). Duration of smoking of {\textless}20 and {\textgreater}20 years was associated with RRs of 1.07 and 1.44, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001 for trend). Cumulative smoking of {\textless}10, 10-20, 20-30, and {\textgreater}30 pack-years was associated with RRs of 1.13, 1.23, 1.39, and 1.71, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001 for trend).

Despite the advances in our understanding of its pathobiology, the chemotherapy-directed management has remained largely unchanged in the past 40 years. However, various novel agents have demonstrated clinical activity, either as single agents (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) inhibitors, vadastuximab) or in combination with standard induction/consolidation at diagnosis and with salvage regimens at relapse. The classes of agents described in this review include novel cytotoxic chemotherapies (CPX-351 and vosaroxin), epigenetic modifiers (guadecitabine, IDH inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibitors), FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 (FLT3) inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates (vadastuximab), as well as cell cycle inhibitors (volasertib), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors, and aminopeptidase inhibitors. These agents are actively undergoing clinical investigation alone or in combination with available chemotherapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Birth asphyxia is a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality in developing nations, such as Ethiopia. Though Ethiopia has made considerable achievement in the reduction of under-five mortality rate, the neonatal mortality burden has not experienced the same reduction, which may be attributed to birth asphyxia. Thus, this study attempts to assess the prevalence and associated factors of birth asphyxia among newborns in public hospitals in the northeastern Amhara region, Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 357 births from 1st April to 2nd May 2018. The sample size was proportionally allocated to randomly selected three public hospitals namely, Dessie referral hospital, Debre Berhan referral hospital, and Woldia general hospital. The allocation was made by taking the average number of deliveries given in each hospital six months before the data collection period. Using the delivery registration of hospitals a systematic random sampling technique was used to get all study participants. The diagnosis of birth asphyxia was confirmed based on the physician's diagnosis of an APGAR score {\textless} 7 in the 1st and 5th minutes of birth. A pretested and structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Variables with p-values {\textless} 0.25 in the bivariable analysis were entered into a multivariable logistic regression analysis. A statistical significant level was declared at a p-value of {\textless}0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of birth asphyxia was found to occur 22.6\% of the time [95\% CI 19.2\% - 26.4\%] in the first minute of birth. In the multivariable logistic regression being primipara [AOR = 3.77: 95\% CI 1.86, 7.65], presented with complicated labor [AOR = 3.45: 95\% CI 1.58, 7.49], premature rupture of membrane [AOR = 3.85: 95\% CI 1.76, 8.44) and having blood-stained amniotic fluid at birth [AOR = 5.02: 95\% CI 1.69, 14.87] were the independent predictors of birth asphyxia. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that birth asphyxia is a common newborn complication in the Amhara region. Integrated mitigation measure to reduce neonatal mortality in the Amahar region should give due attention to primipara women and for these high-risk pregnancies in order for the region to achieve national and global commitment to have sustainable change in women and neonatal health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Premature rupture of membrane (PROM) is linked to significant maternal prenatal mortalities and morbidity. In Ethiopia, where maternal mortality is still high, the maternal and fetal outcomes in PROM is very important to decrease maternal and child mortality and for better management and prevention of complications. Thus, this study aimed to detect the maternal and fetal outcomes and associated factors in term PROM at Mizan-Aman General Hospital, south-west Ethiopia. METHODS: A retrospective cross sectional study was conducted using data available at Mizan-Aman General Hospital during a period of 3 years (January 2011 to December 2013). We examined records of 4 525 women who gave birth in the hospital; out of these women, 185 were diagnosed with term PROM and all of them were included in the study. The data of these women were collected using a checklist based on registration books. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 statistical package. The association between independent and dependent variables was assessed by bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. 95\%CI and P value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 4 525 women who gave birth in the hospital, 202 were complicated by term PROM. About 22.2\% of the women showed unfavorable maternal outcomes. The most common cause of maternal morbidity and mortality was puerperal sepsis. About 33.5\% of neonates experienced unfavorable outcomes. The duration of PROM {\textgreater}12 hours (AOR=5.6, 95\%CI 1.3-24.1) latency {\textgreater}24 hours (AOR=2.8, 95\%CI 1.7-11.8), residing in rural areas (AOR=4.2, 95\%CI 3.96-29.4) and birth weight less than 2 500 g were associated with unfavorable outcomes. CONCLUSION: Women residing in rural areas, long latency, and neonates with birth weight less 2 500 g may have unfavorable outcomes. Therefore, optimum obstetric and medical care is essential for the reduction of the devastating complications related to disorders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Birth asphyxia is a major contributor to neonatal mortality worldwide. In Ethiopia, birth asphyxia remains a severe condition that leads to significant mortality and morbidity. This study aims to assess the prevalence and contributing factors of birth asphyxia among the neonates delivered at the Nigist Eleni Mohammed Memorial Teaching Hospital, Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: This hospital-based cross-sectional study was carried out on 279 participants using the systematic sampling method during June 1-30, 2019. Data were collected using a pretested structured interviewer administered questionnaire, check list and chart review, which was used to retrieve medical information and mother's test results that could not be captured by the interview. Data were entered into EpiData (version 3.1) and analyzed using SPSS software (version 24). Multivariable regression analysis was used to identify the association between the independent variables and outcome variable with a 95\% confidence interval (CI). RESULT: The overall prevalence of birth asphyxia among newborns was found to be 15.1\%. Factors that were significantly associated with birth asphyxia included mothers aged ≥35 (AOR = 6.4; 95\% CI = 2.0-20.5), primigravida (AOR = 5.1; 95\% CI =2.0-13.3), prolonged second stage of labor (AOR = 4.6; 95\%CI =1.6-13.3), preterm birth (AOR = 4.7; 95\% CI =1.5-14.1), meconium stained amniotic fluid (AOR = 7.5; 95\% CI =2.5-21.4) and tight nuchal (AOR = 3.1; 95\% CI =1.2-9.3). CONCLUSION: Birth asphyxia is still prevalent in the study setting. The obtained findings indicated that the mothers aged ≥35, being primigravida, preterm birth, meconium stained amniotic fluid and tight nuchal were the factors associated with birth asphyxia. The results of this study show the need for better maternal care, creating awareness about contributing factors of birth asphyxia to the maternity health professionals, careful monitoring of labor, and identifying and taking proper measures that could help in reducing the occurrence of birth asphyxia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence of premature rupture of membranes (PROM) in low-resource settings, the preferred mode of delivery remains unclear. We compared the perinatal mortality in a prospective cohort of women with PROM after 28 weeks following vaginal or caesarean delivery at Mulago Hospital with the aim of adopting evidence based practice and improving patient care. METHODS: Between November 2015 and May 2016, 1455 women with PROM after 28 weeks of gestation and their newborns were prospectively followed from admission to discharge at Mulago Hospital. The primary outcome was perinatal mortality. Secondary neonatal outcomes included sepsis and admission to the Special Care Unit. Maternal outcomes included maternal deaths and complications. Outcomes were compared between women who had vaginal vs. caesarean delivery using multivariable logistic regression. All statistical tests were 2-sided with the level of statistical significance set at p {\textless} 0.05. RESULTS: The incidence of PROM was 12.1\%. The perinatal mortality following PROM was 65 per 1000 live births. Of the 1425 women with PROM, 991 (69.5\%) had vaginal delivery and 434 (30.5\%) underwent Caesarean section. There was no statistical difference in perinatal mortality by the mode of delivery (vaginal vs. caesarean) in PROM (p = 0.12). The risk factors for perinatal mortality included chorioamnionitis, failure to administer corticosteroids in preterm PROM, gestational age (28-33 weeks), duration of drainage of liquor (24-48 hours), and presence of maternal complications. Caesarean delivery was associated with increased maternal postpartum infections, admission to the Special Care Unit and maternal death. CONCLUSION: In low resource settings, vaginal delivery is the preferred mode of delivery for PROM after 28 weeks gestation. It is associated with lesser maternal and perinatal morbidity when compared to caesarean delivery.},

	volume = {4},
	abstract = {Background. Prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM) is a common and significant cause of preterm labor and has a major impact on neonatal morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine maternal risk factors and the prevalence rate of neonatal complications following PROM . This study also detected the role of maternal antimicrobial treatment on neonatal complications.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed at Ghaem hospital, Mashhad, Iran; from March 2008 to April 2010 to evaluate newborns’ outcome that were born from mothers with prolonged premature rupture of membranes (PROM{\textgreater} 18 hours). Maternal risk factors, antibiotic administration and its influences on neonatal complications were evaluated. Eligible infants were categorized into group I (symptomatic infants), II (mother with chorioamnionitis) and III (asymptomatic infants).
Results. 150 infants were included in the study. 12 (7.7\%) infants had definitive infections (meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia), 101(67\%) infants were premature and 88(58.6\%) infants had mothers with a history of antibiotic intake. Maternal risk factors were reported in the following order: previous PROM (10\%), addiction (8\%), high urinary tract infection (5/3\%), diabetes (4.7\%), placenta abruption (4.7\%), preeclampsia (3/3\%) and cercelage (2\%). Neonatal complications related with PROM were prematurity (67.3\%), respiratory distress syndrome (22.6\%), asphyxia (8.6\%), meningitis (5.2\%), sepsis (4\%), pneumonia (1.3\%) and death (4.6\%). History of antibiotic administration to mothers with PROM was negative in four babies with sepsis and one with meningitis.
Conclusion. The most common complication of PROM was prematurity and its side effects, but infection is the most important modifiable complication. Although antimicrobial treatment of women with a history of PROM improves neonatal outcome through reducing neonatal sepsis and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), but the incidence rate of meningitis and pneumonia may be increased.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: A large number of medications have been implicated in the genesis of gynecomastia. However, gynecomastia is common in men, asymptomatic, increases with age, and is considered to be due to an increased estradiol/testosterone ratio. This complicates the interpretation of medication-related gynecomastia. Therefore, we have reviewed the literature in order to assess the data relating gynecomastia onset with utilization of specific medications. METHODS: The literature was searched in PubMed and the Ovid/Medline databases from the 1946 to January 2015 with the search terminology of "gynecomastia, drugs/medications." A few other articles were found and included. RESULTS: One hundred ten publications were reviewed. Sixty-three were single case reports. There were 24 population-based studies of which 8 were HIV-infected patients treated with antiretroviral agents. Among the case reports, 49 were for individual medications, and 2 were reports of antineoplastic or antiretroviral drug regimens. In the great majority, mastodynia with or without breast enlargement was present and referred to as gynecomastia. Generally, hormonal profiles could not explain the breast enlargement. The pain/tenderness and breast enlargement resolved spontaneously over time. CONCLUSION: Many different medications have been associated with the presence of "gynecomastia." Generally, it presents as a syndrome characterized by a single painful/tender breast (mastodynia) associated with breast enlargement and is transient. We suggest that these cases be referred to as an acute gynecomastia syndrome. This syndrome also occurs independent of medication use. Thus, in an individual patient, whether it is medication induced often remains uncertain. The pathogenesis remains unknown.},

Investigations revealed hypokalemia; he was advised to stop hydrochlorothiazide and consume potassium-rich diet; since he did not respond to this, spironolactone was added. The patient improved symptomatically but developed painful swelling of the right breast after 12 months of treatment which was suspected to be spironolactone-induced gynecomastia. Within a month of stopping the drug, pain in the right breast subsided followed by decrease in size of swelling. Literature search indicates bilateral gynecomastia by spironolactone, but when clinician encounters unilateral presentation, they should consider the possibility of drug-induced etiology.

	abstract = {The long-term efficacy and tolerance of spironolactone in essential hypertension was evaluated among 20,812 patients referred to the Broussais and St. Joseph systemic hypertension clinics between 1976 and 1985 by using information prospectively collected in the computerized ARTEMIS data bank. In 182 patients (51 men, 131 women) treated with spironolactone alone during a mean follow-up period of 23 months, a mean dose of 96.5 mg decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) by 18 and 10 mm Hg, respectively, below pretherapeutic levels. The BP decrease was greater with doses of 75 to 100 mg (12.4\% and 12.2\%) than with doses of 25 to 50 mg (5.3 and 6.5\%, p less than 0.001), but no additional decrease was found with doses above 150 mg. Plasma creatinine level increased modestly (8.3 mumol/liters), as did plasma potassium level (0.6 mmol/liters) (both p less than 0.001); uric acid level increased, but not significantly (10.5 mumol/liter). Fasting blood glucose and total cholesterol levels did not change, triglyceride levels increased slightly (0.1 mmol/liter, p less than 0.05). These changes were similar in both sexes and were not influenced by length of follow-up. Among the 699 men prescribed spironolactone alone or in association with another antihypertensive treatment, 91 cases of gynecomastia developed (13\%). Gynecomastia was reversible and dose-related; at doses of 50 mg or less the incidence was 6.9\%, but 52.2\% for doses of 150 mg or higher.

	abstract = {Chronic tonsillitis is a recurring infection that most often occurs in the throat, especially in children and adolescents. Tonsillectomy is one type of Ear Nose Throat (ENT) surgery that is most often performed on children, adolescents and adults. Tonsillectomy is also a procedure that can be done if there is a chronic infection or a recurring infection. Factors that can affect tonsillectomy are age, major complaints and size of the tonsils. This study was conducted to determine the relationship of tonsillectomy with age, major complaints and the size of tonsils in chronic tonsillitis patients in RSPBA of Lampung city in 2018-2019. This study uses cross-sectional, quantitative, analytic methods with secondary tonsillitis data collection. Sampling uses a total sampling technique. Data collection was done by recording data in the form of major complaints, age and size of the tonsils and analyzed using the chi-square test. The results showed that 109 tonsillitis patients showed that the majority of tonsillitis patients were group: age ≤ 18 years as many as 73 people, tonsillectomy was 66 people (90.4\%), main complaints {\textgreater}1 were 90 people, tonsillectomy was 83 people (83 people) 92.2\%) and T3-T4 tonsil size of 70 people, with tonsillectomy of 65 people (92.2\%). The results also showed that there was a relationship between tonsillectomy between age (p = 0.01, OR = 3.626), main complaints (p = 0.00, OR = 13.175), tonsil size (p = 0.00, OR = 5.778) in chronic tonsilits patients at RSPBA Bandar Lampung in 2018-2019. This study concluded that there was a significant relationship between tonsillectomy with age, major complaints and the size of tonsils in chronic tonsillitis patients in Bandar Lampung RSPBA 2018-2019 with a p-value {\textless}0.05.},

As the outcomes of cataract surgery became better, the use of lens surgery as a refractive modality in patients without cataracts has increased in interest and in popularity. Removal of the crystalline lens for refractive purposes or refractive lens exchange (RLE) presents several advantages over corneal refractive surgery. Patients with high degrees of myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism are still not good candidates for laser surgery. Moreover, presbyopia can currently only be corrected with monovision or reading spectacles. RLE supplemented with multifocal or accommodating intraocular lenses (IOLs) in combination with corneal astigmatic procedures might address all refractive errors including presbyopia, and eliminate the future need for cataract surgery.},

In addition, patients were recalled for a follow up examination, which included dilated retinal examination with scleral indentation., Results: Two cases (3.2\%) of retinal detachment occurred at intervals of 2 months and 5 months following uncomplicated RLE procedures. A posterior chamber intraocular lens was inserted in 46 eyes (74\%). YAG laser posterior capsulotomy was performed in 38 of 62 eyes (61\%) and did not represent a risk for retinal detachment., Conclusion: Refractive lens exchange results in rapid and predictable improvement in unaided vision in patients with high myopia.

	abstract = {Improved efficacy, predictability, and safety of modern phacoemulsification have resulted in cataract surgery being considered as a refractive procedure. Refractive lens exchange by definition is a surgery aimed at replacing the cataractous or clear crystalline lens with an intraocular lens (IOL) in cases of high ametropia. The excellent intraocular optics of this procedure provide a better visual outcome as compared with laser refractive surgery in high myopia. With advances in technology and IOL formulas, the predictability of refractive outcome after cataract surgery in high myopes has improved. The option of addressing presbyopia using multifocal/accommodating IOLs or monovision results in patients achieving reasonable spectacle independence. The most important concern with respect to phacoemulsification in high myopia is the risk of pseudophakic retinal detachment. High myopia is an independent risk factor for retinal detachment, and recent publications have reported a much lesser risk of retinal detachment specifically attributable to phacoemulsification in high myopes, especially if a thorough posterior segment evaluation is done and patients are followed up until development of complete posterior vitreous detachment. Refractive lens exchange is an effective and safe option to correct high myopia and can significantly improve quality of life in select patients.},

Placido-based topographers started an exciting anterior corneal surface analysis that allows the development of current corneal tomographers that provide a full three-dimensional reconstruction of the cornea including elevation, curvature, and pachymetry data of anterior and posterior corneal surfaces. Although, there is not an accepted reference standard technology for corneal topography description and it is not possible to determine which device produces the most accurate topographic measurements, placido-based topographers are a valuable technology to be used in primary eye care and corneal tomograhers expanding the possibilities to explore cornea and anterior eye facilitating diagnosis and follow-up in several situations, raising patient follow-up, and improving the knowledge regarding to the corneal anatomy. Main disadvantages of placido-based topographers include the absence of information about the posterior corneal surface and limited corneal surface coverage without data from the para-central and/or peripheral corneal surface. However, corneal tomographers show repeatable anterior and posterior corneal surfaces measurements, providing full corneal thickness data improving cornea, and anterior surface assessment. However, differences between devices suggest that they are not interchangeable in clinical practice.},

The fields of preventive medicine and public health share the objectives of promoting general health, preventing disease, and applying epidemiologic techniques to these goals. This paper discusses a conceptual approach between the overlap and potential synergies of integrative medicine principles and practices with preventive medicine in the context of these levels of prevention, acknowledging the relative deficiency of research on the effectiveness of practice-based integrative care. One goal of integrative medicine is to make the widest array of appropriate options available to patients, ultimately blurring the boundaries between conventional and complementary medicine. Both disciplines should be subject to rigorous scientific inquiry so that interventions that are efficacious and effective are systematically distinguished from those that are not. Furthermore, principles of preventive medicine can be infused into prevalent practices in complementary and integrative medicine, promoting public health in the context of more responsible practices. The case is made that an integrative preventive approach involves the responsible use of science with responsiveness to the needs of patients that persist when conclusive data are exhausted, providing a framework to make clinical decisions among integrative therapies.},

The Pediatric Nurses' Knowledge and Attitude Survey (PNKAS) was used to evaluate the nurses' knowledge and attitudes. The PNKAS consists of 40 questions. In this study, 29.9\% of nurses had a diploma and 40.6\% associate's, 25.0\% bachelor's, and 4.5\% master's degree, and respondents had an everage 6.1 years pediatric nursing experience. The total mean score on the PNKAS scale was 38.2\%. The highest score was 65\%, and the lowest score 15\%. The findings of the survey show that pediatric nurses in Turkey have insufficient knowledge regarding pain management and could benefit from additional education on that issue.},

	abstract = {Spinal metastases are the most common tumors of the spine, comprising approximately 90\% of masses encountered with spinal imaging. Spinal metastases are more commonly found as bone metastasis, although they are not limited to bone metastasis, and approximately 20\% present with symptoms of spinal canal invasion and cord compression. Within the spinal column, metastasis is more commonly found in the thoracic region, followed by the lumbar region, while the cervical region is the least likely place professionals find metastasis [1]. While evaluating spinal metastasis on MRI imaging, a defining feature of these lesions is the sparing of intervertebral disc space. This disc space is almost always involved during infection. Metastatic diseases to the spine spread through several different routes which include venous hematogenous spread versus the arterial spread, direct tumor extension, and lastly lymphatic spread. Among the routes mentioned above, hematogenous spread through Batson’s plexus system is the most common pathway for tumor embolization and spinal invasion. The following summary emphasizes the essential knowledge necessary to have while treating patients with spinal metastasis [2][3].},

	abstract = {There are a variety of treatment options for patients with spinal metastasis, and predicting prognosis is essential for selecting the proper treatment. The purpose of the present study was to identify the signiﬁcant prognostic factors for the survival of patients with spinal metastasis. We retrospectively reviewed 143 patients with spinal metastasis. The median age was 61 years. Eleven factors reported previously were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model: gender, age, performance status, neurological deﬁcits, pain, type of primary tumor, metastasis to major organs, previous chemotherapy, disease-free interval before spinal metastasis, multiple spinal metastases, and extra-spinal bone metastasis. The average survival of study patients after the ﬁrst visit to our clinic was 22 months. Multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that type of primary tumor (hazard ratio [HR]＝6.80, ＜0.001), metastasis to major organs (HR＝2.01, ＝0.005), disease-free interval before spinal metastasis (HR＝1.77, ＝0.028), and extra-spinal bone metastasis (HR＝1.75, ＝0.017) were signiﬁcant prognostic factors. Type of primary tumor was the most powerful prognostic factor. Other prognostic factors may diﬀer among the types of primary tumor and may also be closely associated with primary disease activity. Further analysis of factors predicting prognosis should be conducted with respect to each type of primary tumor to help accurately predict prognosis.},

A spinal metastasis may cause pain, instability and neurological injuries. The diffusion through Batson venous system is the principal process of spinal metastasis, but the dissemination is possible also through arterial and lymphatic system or by contiguity. Once cancer cells have invaded the bone, they produce growth factors that stimulate osteoblastic or osteolytic activity resulting in bone remodeling with release of other growth factors that lead to a vicious cycle of bone destruction and growth of local tumour.},

	abstract = {Spine tumors comprise a small percentage of reasons for back pain and other symptoms originating in the spine. The majority of the tumors involving the spinal column are metastases of visceral organ cancers which are mostly seen in older patients. Primary musculoskeletal system sarcomas involving the spinal column are rare. Benign tumors and tumor-like lesions of the musculoskeletal system are mostly seen in young patients and often cause instability and canal compromise. Optimal diagnosis and treatment of spine tumors require a multidisciplinary approach and thorough knowledge of both spine surgery and musculoskeletal tumor surgery. Either primary or metastatic tumors involving the spine are demanding problems in terms of diagnosis and treatment. Spinal instability and neurological compromise are the main and critical problems in patients with tumors of the spinal column. In the past, only a few treatment options aiming short-term control were available for treatment of primary and metastatic spine tumors. Spine surgeons adapted their approach for spine tumors according to orthopaedic oncologic principles in the last 20 years. Advances in imaging, surgical techniques and implant technology resulted in better diagnosis and surgical treatment options, especially for primary tumors. Also, modern chemotherapy drugs and regimens with new radiotherapy and radiosurgery options caused moderate to long-term local and systemic control for even primary sarcomas involving the spinal column.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the most distinctive management competencies is related to the ability to structure the strategic vision, develop long-term plans, and communicate them efficiently to the employees in order to empower them to enact. These managerial competencies in complex organizations are strongly related to the capacity to engage professionals as a predictor of high-performing organizations. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between top management competencies, information sharing, and organizational performance in public health care system and to look at the management role in assuring information sharing on organizational strategies to achieve professionals' engagement. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This relationship is empirically tested using the longitudinal data of public health care organizations from the Tuscany Region (Italy). The top management competencies and information sharing are evaluated by the heads of the departments. While information sharing refers to the organizational level (e.g., to convey the objectives), managerial competencies refer to the individual level (e.g., to manage conflict). A random effect regression model is estimated using average responses by the health organization. Data come from the multidimensional performance evaluation system (2008 to 2014 years). RESULTS: Findings show that managerial competencies are positively associated to organizational performance. Moreover, managerial competencies are strongly linked to the information sharing process developed into the organizations. In particular, managerial competencies play a significant role on whole performance, and results are mediated by the use of mature information sharing instruments such as benchmarking of performance results. CONCLUSION: Systematic information sharing process regarding performance results, goals, and organizational structure provided by top management seems an effective strategy to engage professionals. Control variables suggest that top management tenure and turnover do not have an effect, whereas bigger health care organizations seem to negatively influence this relation. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Information sharing is the basis for clinicians' engagement and adds value to organizational performance.},

However, conceptual clarity is lacking in the literature and in practice. Therefore, a systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted to reveal the different conceptualizations of medical leadership in terms of definitions, roles and activities, and personal-and context-specific features. Eight databases were systematically searched for eligible studies, including empirical studies published in peer-reviewed journals that included physicians carrying out a manager or leadership role in a hospital setting. Finally, 34 articles were included and their findings were synthesized and analyzed narratively. Medical leadership is conceptualized in literature either as physicians with formal managerial roles or physicians who act as informal 'leaders' in daily practices. In both forms, medical leaders must carry out general management and leadership activities and acts to balance between management and medicine, because these physicians must accomplish both organizational and medical staff objectives. To perform effectively, credibility among medical peers appeared to be the most important factor, followed by a scattered list of fields of knowledge, skills and attitudes. Competing logics, role ambiguity and a lack of time and support were perceived as barriers. However, the extent to which physicians must master all elicited features, remains ambiguous. Furthermore, the extent to which medical leadership entails a shift or a reallocation of tasks that are at the core of medical professional work remains unclear. Future studies should implement stronger research designs in which more theory is used to study the effect of medical leadership on professional work, medical staff governance, and subsequently, the quality and efficiency of care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A widespread assumption across health systems suggests that greater clinicians' involvement in governance and management roles would have wider benefits for the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare organisations. However, despite growing interest around the topic, it is still poorly understood how managers with a clinical background might specifically affect healthcare performance outcomes. The purpose of this review is, therefore, to map out and critically appraise quantitatively-oriented studies investigating this phenomenon within the acute hospital sector. METHODS: The review has focused on scientific papers published in English in international journals and conference proceedings. The articles have been extracted through a Boolean search strategy from ISI Web of Science citation and search source. No time constraints were imposed. A manual search by keywords and citation tracking was also conducted concentrating on highly ranked public sector governance and management journals. Nineteen papers were identified as a match for the research criteria and, subsequently, were classified on the basis of six items. Finally, a thematic mapping has been carried out leading to identify three main research sub-streams on the basis of the types of performance outcomes investigated. RESULTS AND CONTRIBUTION: The analysis of the extant literature has revealed that research focusing on clinicians' involvement in leadership positions has explored its implications for the management of financial resources, the quality of care offered and the social performance of service providers. In general terms, the findings show a positive impact of clinical leadership on different types of outcome measures, with only a handful of studies highlighting a negative impact on financial and social performance. Therefore, this review lends support to the prevalent move across health systems towards increasing the presence of clinicians in leadership positions in healthcare organisations. Furthermore, we present an explanatory model summarising the reasons offered in the reviewed studies to justify the findings and provide suggestions for future research.},

Initial ASSESSMENT AND CHOICE OF INTERVENTION: Initial assessment of hospital management systems demonstrated weak functioning in several management areas. In response, we developed with the Ethiopian Ministry of Health (MoH) a novel Master of Hospital Administration (MHA) program, reflecting a collaborative effort of the MoH, the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative, Jimma University and Yale University. The MHA is a 2-year executive style educational program to develop a new cadre of hospital leaders, comprising 5\% classroom learning and 85\% executive practice. IMPLEMENTATION: The MHA has been implemented with 55 hospital leaders in the position of chief executive officer within the MoH, with courses taught in collaboration by faculty of the North and the South universities. EVALUATION AND LESSONS LEARNED: The program has enrolled two cohorts of hospital leaders and is working in more than half of the government hospitals in Ethiopia. Lessons learned include the need to: (i) balance education in applied, technical skills with more abstract thinking and problem solving, (ii) recognize the interplay between management education and policy reform, (iii) remain flexible as policy changes have direct impact on the project, (iv) be realistic about resource constraints in low-income settings, particularly information technology limitations, and (v) manage the transfer of knowledge for longer term sustainability.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Growing evidence suggests that nurse staffing affects the quality of care in hospitals, but little is known about whether the educational composition of registered nurses (RNs) in hospitals is related to patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the proportion of hospital RNs educated at the baccalaureate level or higher is associated with risk-adjusted mortality and failure to rescue (deaths in surgical patients with serious complications). DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: Cross-sectional analyses of outcomes data for 232 342 general, orthopedic, and vascular surgery patients discharged from 168 nonfederal adult general Pennsylvania hospitals between April 1, 1998, and November 30, 1999, linked to administrative and survey data providing information on educational composition, staffing, and other characteristics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk-adjusted patient mortality and failure to rescue within 30 days of admission associated with nurse educational level. RESULTS: The proportion of hospital RNs holding a bachelor's degree or higher ranged from 0\% to 77\% across the hospitals. After adjusting for patient characteristics and hospital structural characteristics (size, teaching status, level of technology), as well as for nurse staffing, nurse experience, and whether the patient's surgeon was board certified, a 10\% increase in the proportion of nurses holding a bachelor's degree was associated with a 5\% decrease in both the likelihood of patients dying within 30 days of admission and the odds of failure to rescue (odds ratio, 0.95; 95\% confidence interval, 0.91-0.99 in both cases). CONCLUSION: In hospitals with higher proportions of nurses educated at the baccalaureate level or higher, surgical patients experienced lower mortality and failure-to-rescue rates.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Despite common assumptions that doctors are well placed to lead hospitals and healthcare organisations, the peer-reviewed literature contains little evidence on the performance of doctors in leadership roles in comparison with that of non-medical managers. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether there is an association between the leader's medical background and management performance in terms of organisational performance or patient outcomes. METHODS: We searched for peer-reviewed, English language studies using Medline, Embase and Emerald Management between 2005 and 2017. We included quantitative, qualitative and mixed method empirical studies on the performance of senior healthcare managers where participants were described as doctors or leaders and where comparative performance data were provided on non-medical leaders. Studies without full text available, or no organisational, leadership behaviour or patient measures, were excluded. RESULTS: The search, conducted in Medline (n=3395), Embase (n=1913) and Emerald Management (n=454) databases, yielded 3926 entries. After the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 studies remained. Twelve studies found that there were positive differences between medical and non-medical leaders, and eight studies correlated those findings with hospital performance or patient outcomes. Six studies examined the composition of boards of directors; otherwise, there were few common areas of investigation. Five inter-related themes emerged from a narrative analysis: the impact of medical leadership on outcomes; doctors on boards; contribution of qualifications and experience; the medical leader as an individual or part of a team and doctors transitioning into the medical leadership role. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A modest body of evidence supports the importance of including doctors on organisational governing boards. Despite many published articles on the topic of whether hospitals and healthcare organisations perform better when led by doctors, there were few empirical studies that directly compared the performance of medical and non-medical managers. This is an under-researched area that requires further funding and focus.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Summit of Independent European Vaccination Experts (SIEVE) recommended in 2007 that efforts be made to improve healthcare workers' knowledge and beliefs about vaccines, and their attitudes towards them, to increase vaccination coverage. The aim of the study was to compile and analyze the areas of disagreement in the existing evidence about the relationship between healthcare workers' knowledge, beliefs and attitudes about vaccines and their intentions to vaccinate the populations they serve. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in four electronic databases for studies published in any of seven different languages between February 1998 and June 2009. We included studies conducted in developed countries that used statistical methods to relate or associate the variables included in our research question. Two independent reviewers verified that the studies met the inclusion criteria, assessed the quality of the studies and extracted their relevant characteristics. The data were descriptively analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 2354 references identified in the initial search, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The diversity in the study designs and in the methods used to measure the variables made it impossible to integrate the results, and each study had to be assessed individually. All the studies found an association in the direction postulated by the SIEVE experts: among healthcare workers, higher awareness, beliefs that are more aligned with scientific evidence and more favorable attitudes toward vaccination were associated with greater intentions to vaccinate. All the studies included were cross-sectional; thus, no causal relationship between the variables was established. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that interventions aimed at improving healthcare workers' knowledge, beliefs and attitudes about vaccines should be encouraged, and their impact on vaccination coverage should be assessed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This paper addresses the health care system from a global perspective and the importance of human resources management (HRM) in improving overall patient health outcomes and delivery of health care services. METHODS: We explored the published literature and collected data through secondary sources. RESULTS: Various key success factors emerge that clearly affect health care practices and human resources management. This paper will reveal how human resources management is essential to any health care system and how it can improve health care models. Challenges in the health care systems in Canada, the United States of America and various developing countries are examined, with suggestions for ways to overcome these problems through the proper implementation of human resources management practices. Comparing and contrasting selected countries allowed a deeper understanding of the practical and crucial role of human resources management in health care. CONCLUSION: Proper management of human resources is critical in providing a high quality of health care. A refocus on human resources management in health care and more research are needed to develop new policies. Effective human resources management strategies are greatly needed to achieve better outcomes from and access to health care around the world.},

Synthesizing information from the existing literature, we have developed an empirically based framework to help organizations and managers understand what to do with patient experience feedback to improve health care quality at the organizational level. We identified six post-data collection/analysis activities, which were categorized into three main themes: 1) make sense of the data, 2) communicate and explain the data, and 3) plan for improvement. Our framework suggests that simply executing a survey will not improve performance. It is necessary that leaders understand the data, disseminate findings to all stakeholders, help staff understand the data, and then create a platform where all key stakeholders can be involved in discussing the results to generate improvement plans.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The German healthcare system is facing ongoing radical change and development. The increasing tendency to urge hospitals and medical staff to work in a profit-oriented way constitute among other factors clear present and future challenges. Physicians and surgeons in particular increasingly complain of increasing stress attributed to measures aiming at cost reduction in hospitals. The highest priority must always be patient satisfaction and the delivery of good medical and human service. Problem description: The health care market in Germany has become an increasingly complex business with uncertain and unpredictable future events. Strategic planning has to enable hospitals to quickly and flexibly adapt strategies to changes in the environment that become essential to their success. The most important task is to develop a strategy that can be applied with success in all possible future scenarios. This is known as the core strategy.
DISCUSSION: The core strategy for hospitals in Germany is complementary education of the medical staff as well as top management. Accordingly, courses, workshops or even part-time graduate or postgraduate education in business and economics are recommended for the medical staff. As far as non-medical hospital executives are concerned, there is no better way than to host them in a hospital department for a period of 6-12 months. This paves the way for understanding and accepting each others' opinion which increases hospital performance.
CONCLUSION: Proper and complementary education of the medical staff as well as of non-medical top executives and managers of hospitals is recommended as the core strategy. This harmonizes both professional medical and managerial efforts with a synergy effect that allows soundly facing the increasingly challenging environment of the health care sector in general and in hospitals in particular.},

The present study assesses these factors as they relate to the attainment of top healthcare leadership positions. We defined our sample as the chief administrative officers for hospitals ranked in the 2007 U.S. News \& World Report Best Hospitals list as our sample. Educational backgrounds were determined through assistance from Witt-Kieffer, an executive search firm with an extensive database of executive profiles, which was supplemented by web searches and telephone contacts to ensure data integrity and currency. Staff of the Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education (CAHME) verified whether the MHA/equivalent programs were accredited at the time the individuals graduated by cross-checking against historical records. An aggregate estimate of degree prevalence was used to assess the extent to which academic background appeared to have stronger-than-expected prevalence on the list. Results suggest that representation among the top executives was associated with (1) having a master's degree in administration; (2) the degree being an MHA/equivalent; and (3) the degree being from a CAHME-accredited program. The implications of the results are discussed in relation to views of health administration as a profession as well as the accreditation of professional graduate degree programs.},

	shorttitle = {The effect of educational qualification on job performance},
	url = {http://repository.unam.edu.na/handle/11070/1441},
	abstract = {The extent to which organisations perform or achieve set objectives is a function of 
competencies of staff. As such employers hire and place people in various positions based on educational qualifications required by the job and expect good performance. However, this has not been the case, raising concerns over the ability of employees with educational qualifications to perform on the job. The problem in this case is that if employees with educational qualifications contribute only marginally more to job performance than less educated workers do, then higher costs of staffing with highly educated workers are unlikely to be recouped. This 
situation creates uncertainty on whether organizations such as Social Security Commission should continue to subsidize current employees to acquire bachelors or advanced degrees hence the need to rigorously assess the short-term returns (e.g., improved performance) and long-term returns (e.g., heightened occupational commitment) on those investments. The main objective of the study is to identify and examine the relationship between job performances of employees against academic qualifications in order to provide recommendations to the sse management on how best educational qualifications can contribute to improved job performance. This study used a mixed approach of quantitative and qualitative methods mainly descriptive statistics (i.e. frequencies) to determine the extent to which employees performance reflects the educational qualifications attained. The aim is to ensure that there is synergy between educational qualifications and competencies of employees to ultimately improve job performance. Overall, the findings of the study confirmed that educational qualifications have a significant 
bearing on job performance. The higher the education level. the more are the effects of education and skill on job performance. As such peoples ability to understand and use advanced technology is determined by the level of their education. The educated workers tend to be more responsive in receiving instructions and doing new tasks and easily adopt new technology. which 
increases their ability to innovate and improve job performance. However. the main factors considered to limit the positive effect of educational qualifications on 
job performance at the workplace include the quality of the work environment, organisational structure and processes, the assignment of employees in posts which did not match their qualifications and the lack of incentive systems. The findings have important policy implications in that they suggest the need for measures that can enhance the positive effect of educational qualifications on job performance.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is the most commonly used physical therapy treatment for women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). It is sometimes also recommended for mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) and, less commonly, urgency urinary incontinence (UUI).This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2001 and last updated in 2014. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of PFMT for women with urinary incontinence (UI) in comparison to no treatment, placebo or sham treatments, or other inactive control treatments; and summarise the findings of relevant economic evaluations. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (searched 12 February 2018), which contains trials identified from CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, handsearching of journals and conference proceedings, and the reference lists of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials in women with SUI, UUI or MUI (based on symptoms, signs or urodynamics). One arm of the trial included PFMT. Another arm was a no treatment, placebo, sham or other inactive control treatment arm. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias. We extracted and cross-checked data. A third review author resolved disagreements. We processed data as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We subgrouped trials by diagnosis of UI. We undertook formal meta-analysis when appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: The review included 31 trials (10 of which were new for this update) involving 1817 women from 14 countries. Overall, trials were of small-to-moderate size, with follow-ups generally less than 12 months and many were at moderate risk of bias. There was considerable variation in the intervention's content and duration, study populations and outcome measures. There was only one study of women with MUI and only one study with UUI alone, with no data on cure, cure or improvement, or number of episodes of UI for these subgroups.Symptomatic cure of UI at the end of treatment: compared with no treatment or inactive control treatments, women with SUI who were in the PFMT groups were eight times more likely to report cure (56\% versus 6\%; risk ratio (RR) 8.38, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.68 to 19.07; 4 trials, 165 women; high-quality evidence). For women with any type of UI, PFMT groups were five times more likely to report cure (35\% versus 6\%; RR 5.34, 95\% CI 2.78 to 10.26; 3 trials, 290 women; moderate-quality evidence).Symptomatic cure or improvement of UI at the end of treatment: compared with no treatment or inactive control treatments, women with SUI who were in the PFMT groups were six times more likely to report cure or improvement (74\% versus 11\%; RR 6.33, 95\% CI 3.88 to 10.33; 3 trials, 242 women; moderate-quality evidence). For women with any type of UI, PFMT groups were two times more likely to report cure or improvement than women in the control groups (67\% versus 29\%; RR 2.39, 95\% CI 1.64 to 3.47; 2 trials, 166 women; moderate-quality evidence).UI-specific symptoms and quality of life (QoL) at the end of treatment: compared with no treatment or inactive control treatments, women with SUI who were in the PFMT group were more likely to report significant improvement in UI symptoms (7 trials, 376 women; moderate-quality evidence), and to report significant improvement in UI QoL (6 trials, 348 women; low-quality evidence). For any type of UI, women in the PFMT group were more likely to report significant improvement in UI symptoms (1 trial, 121 women; moderate-quality evidence) and to report significant improvement in UI QoL (4 trials, 258 women; moderate-quality evidence). Finally, for women with mixed UI treated with PFMT, there was one small trial (12 women) reporting better QoL.Leakage episodes in 24 hours at the end of treatment: PFMT reduced leakage episodes by one in women with SUI (mean difference (MD) 1.23 lower, 95\% CI 1.78 lower to 0.68 lower; 7 trials, 432 women; moderate-quality evidence) and in women with all types of UI (MD 1.00 lower, 95\% CI 1.37 lower to 0.64 lower; 4 trials, 349 women; moderate-quality evidence).Leakage on short clinic-based pad tests at the end of treatment: women with SUI in the PFMT groups lost significantly less urine in short (up to one hour) pad tests. The comparison showed considerable heterogeneity but the findings still favoured PFMT when using a random-effects model (MD 9.71 g lower, 95\% CI 18.92 lower to 0.50 lower; 4 trials, 185 women; moderate-quality evidence). For women with all types of UI, PFMT groups also reported less urine loss on short pad tests than controls (MD 3.72 g lower, 95\% CI 5.46 lower to 1.98 lower; 2 trials, 146 women; moderate-quality evidence).Women in the PFMT group were also more satisfied with treatment and their sexual outcomes were better. Adverse events were rare and, in the two trials that did report any, they were minor. The findings of the review were largely supported by the 'Summary of findings' tables, but most of the evidence was downgraded to moderate on methodological grounds. The exception was 'participant-perceived cure' in women with SUI, which was rated as high quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data available, we can be confident that PFMT can cure or improve symptoms of SUI and all other types of UI. It may reduce the number of leakage episodes, the quantity of leakage on the short pad tests in the clinic and symptoms on UI-specific symptom questionnaires. The authors of the one economic evaluation identified for the Brief Economic Commentary reported that the cost-effectiveness of PFMT looks promising. The findings of the review suggest that PFMT could be included in first-line conservative management programmes for women with UI. The long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PFMT needs to be further researched.},

Objectives: To evaluate the effect of Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) based on different dosages strategy for UI. Method: The MEDLINE, Ovid EMbase, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI), and WanFang database were searched for relevant published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) between 1969 to September 31, 2018. All database were searched to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the clinical benefit of BTX-A for management of UI in patients with NDO and IOAB. Results: This meta-analysis involved 19 original studies. The BTX-A was superior to placebo in reducing episodes of UI for NDO patients in all subgroups of different dosages for different durations, and also reduced maximum detrusor pressure in all kinds of 200U and 300U at 6 weeks. However, it increased post void residual in different dosages of 200U at 2 weeks. For IOAB patients, compared to placebo, BTX-A increased detrusor compliance for different dosages of 200U and 300U at 12 and 36 weeks, but it increased risk of urinary tract infections at other dosages. Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicated that BTX-A 200U and 300U are more effective than placebo in the treatment of NDO, with minimal, local, and manageable adverse events. Furthermore, BTX-A 300U and 200U could also improve detrusor compliance of IOAB. However, more RCTs would still be necessary to explore the effect of BTX-A on management of UI in NDO and IOAB patients.},

	abstract = {Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) move towards injured endothelium or inflamed tissues and incorporate into foci of neovascularisation, thereby improving blood flow and tissue repair. Patients with cardiovascular diseases have been shown to exhibit reduced EPC number and function. It has become increasingly apparent that these changes may be effected in response to enhanced oxidative stress, possibly as a result of systemic and localised inflammatory responses. The interplay between inflammation and oxidative stress affects the initiation, progression, and complications of cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies suggest that inflammation and oxidative stress modulate EPC bioactivity. Clinical medications with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, such as statins, thiazolidinediones, angiotensin II receptor 1 blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are currently administered to patients with cardiovascular diseases. These medications appear to exert beneficial effects on EPC biology. This review focuses on EPC biology and explores the links between oxidative stress, inflammation, and development of cardiovascular diseases.},

	abstract = {Ascorbic acid is one of the important water soluble vitamins. It is essential for collagen, carnitine and neurotransmitters biosynthesis. Most plants and animals synthesize ascorbic acid for their own requirement. However, apes and humans can not synthesize ascorbic acid due to lack of an enzyme gulonolactone oxidase. Hence, ascorbic acid has to be supplemented mainly through fruits, vegetables and tablets. The current US recommended daily allowance (RDA) for ascorbic acid ranges between 100-120 mg/per day for adults. Many health benefits have been attributed to ascorbic acid such as antioxidant, anti-atherogenic, anti-carcinogenic, immunomodulator and prevents cold etc. However, lately the health benefits of ascorbic acid has been the subject of debate and controversies viz., Danger of mega doses of ascorbic acid? Does ascorbic acid act as a antioxidant or pro-oxidant? Does ascorbic acid cause cancer or may interfere with cancer therapy? However, the Panel on dietary antioxidants and related compounds stated that the in vivo data do not clearly show a relationship between excess ascorbic acid intake and kidney stone formation, pro-oxidant effects, excess iron absorption. A number of clinical and epidemiological studies on anti-carcinogenic effects of ascorbic acid in humans did not show any conclusive beneficial effects on various types of cancer except gastric cancer. Recently, a few derivatives of ascorbic acid were tested on cancer cells, among them ascorbic acid esters showed promising anticancer activity compared to ascorbic acid. Ascorbyl stearate was found to inhibit proliferation of human cancer cells by interfering with cell cycle progression, induced apoptosis by modulation of signal transduction pathways. However, more mechanistic and human in vivo studies are needed to understand and elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the anti-carcinogenic property of ascorbic acid. Thus, though ascorbic acid was discovered in 17th century, the exact role of this vitamin/nutraceutical in human biology and health is still a mystery in view of many beneficial claims and controversies.},

	abstract = {Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has opened new avenues for the investigation of heart diseases, drug screening and potential autologous cardiac regeneration. However, their application is hampered by inefficient cardiac differentiation, high interline variability, and poor maturation of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs). To identify efficient inducers for cardiac differentiation and maturation of iPSCs and elucidate the mechanisms, we systematically screened sixteen cardiomyocyte inducers on various murine (m) iPSCs and found that only ascorbic acid (AA) consistently and robustly enhanced the cardiac differentiation of eleven lines including eight without spontaneous cardiogenic potential. We then optimized the treatment conditions and demonstrated that differentiation day 2-6, a period for the specification of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), was a critical time for AA to take effect. This was further confirmed by the fact that AA increased the expression of cardiovascular but not mesodermal markers. Noteworthily, AA treatment led to approximately 7.3-fold (miPSCs) and 30.2-fold (human iPSCs) augment in the yield of iPS-CMs. Such effect was attributed to a specific increase in the proliferation of CPCs via the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway by through promoting collagen synthesis. In addition, AA-induced cardiomyocytes showed better sarcomeric organization and enhanced responses of action potentials and calcium transients to β-adrenergic and muscarinic stimulations. These findings demonstrate that AA is a suitable cardiomyocyte inducer for iPSCs to improve cardiac differentiation and maturation simply, universally, and efficiently. These findings also highlight the importance of stimulating CPC proliferation by manipulating extracellular microenvironment in guiding cardiac differentiation of the pluripotent stem cells.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antioxidant vitamin (vitamin E, beta-carotene, and vitamin C) are widely used for preventing major cardiovascular outcomes. However, the effect of antioxidant vitamin on cardiovascular events remains unclear. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched PubMed, EmBase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the proceedings of major conferences for relevant literature. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials that reported on the effects of antioxidant vitamin on cardiovascular outcomes as compared to placebo. Outcomes analyzed were major cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac death, total death, and any possible adverse events. We used the I(2) statistic to measure heterogeneity between trials and calculated risk estimates for cardiovascular outcomes with random-effect meta-analysis. Independent extraction was performed by two reviewers and consensus was reached. Of 293 identified studies, we included 15 trials reporting data on 188209 participants. These studies reported 12749 major cardiovascular events, 6699 myocardial infarction, 3749 strokes, 14122 total death, and 5980 cardiac deaths. Overall, antioxidant vitamin supplementation as compared to placebo had no effect on major cardiovascular events (RR, 1.00; 95\%CI, 0.96-1.03), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.98; 95\%CI, 0.92-1.04), stroke (RR, 0.99; 95\%CI, 0.93-1.05), total death (RR, 1.03; 95\%CI, 0.98-1.07), cardiac death (RR, 1.02; 95\%CI, 0.97-1.07), revascularization (RR, 1.00; 95\%CI, 0.95-1.05), total CHD (RR, 0.96; 95\%CI, 0.87-1.05), angina (RR, 0.98; 95\%CI, 0.90-1.07), and congestive heart failure (RR, 1.07; 95\%CI, 0.96 to 1.19). CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Antioxidant vitamin supplementation has no effect on the incidence of major cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, total death, and cardiac death.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Randomized trials have largely failed to support an effect of antioxidant vitamins on the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Few trials have examined interactions among antioxidants, and, to our knowledge, no previous trial has examined the individual effect of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) on CVD. METHODS: The Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study tested the effects of ascorbic acid (500 mg/d), vitamin E (600 IU every other day), and beta carotene (50 mg every other day) on the combined outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or CVD death among 8171 female health professionals at increased risk in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design. Participants were 40 years or older with a history of CVD or 3 or more CVD risk factors and were followed up for a mean duration of 9.4 years, from 1995-1996 to 2005. RESULTS: A total of 1450 women experienced 1 or more CVD outcomes. There was no overall effect of ascorbic acid (relative risk [RR], 1.02; 95\% CI, 0.92-1.13 [P = .71]), vitamin E (RR, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.85-1.04 [P = .23]), or beta carotene (RR, 1.02; 95\% CI, 0.92-1.13 [P = .71]) on the primary combined end point or on the individual secondary outcomes of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or CVD death. A marginally significant reduction in the primary outcome with active vitamin E was observed among the prespecified subgroup of women with prior CVD (RR, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.79-1.00 [P = .04]; P value for interaction, .07). There were no significant interactions between agents for the primary end point, but those randomized to both active ascorbic acid and vitamin E experienced fewer strokes (P value for interaction, .03). CONCLUSION: There were no overall effects of ascorbic acid, vitamin E, or beta carotene on cardiovascular events among women at high risk for CVD.},

	abstract = {We have shown recently that the temporal order of antioxidant consumption in human blood plasma exposed to a constant flux of aqueous peroxyl radicals is ascorbate = protein thiols greater than bilirubin greater than urate greater than alpha-tocopherol and that detectable lipid peroxidation starts only after ascorbate has been consumed completely. In this paper, we show that it is indeed ascorbate that completely protects plasma lipids against detectable peroxidative damage induced by aqueous peroxyl radicals and that ascorbate is the only plasma antioxidant that can do so. Plasma devoid of ascorbate, but no other endogenous antioxidant, is extremely vulnerable to oxidant stress and susceptible to peroxidative damage to lipids. The plasma proteins' thiols, although they become oxidized immediately upon exposure to aqueous peroxyl radicals, are inefficient radical scavengers and appear to be consumed mainly by autoxidation. Our data demonstrate that ascorbate is the most effective aqueous-phase antioxidant in human blood plasma and suggest that in humans ascorbate is a physiological antioxidant of major importance for protection against diseases and degenerative processes caused by oxidant stress.},

	abstract = {Pharmaceutical doses of ascorbic acid (AA, vitamin C, or its salts) have been reported to exert anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. One proposed mechanism involves direct cytotoxicity mediated by accumulation of ascorbic acid radicals and hydrogen peroxide in the extracellular environment of tumor cells. However, therapeutic effects have been reported at concentrations insufficient to induce direct tumor cell death. We hypothesized that AA may exert anti-angiogenic effects. To test this, we expanded endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from peripheral blood and assessed, whether or not high dose AA would inhibit EPC ability to migrate, change energy metabolism, and tube formation ability. We also evaluated the effects of high dose AA on angiogenic activities of HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) and HUAECs (human umbilical arterial endothelial cells). According to our data, concentrations of AA higher than 100 mg/dl suppressed capillary-like tube formation on Matrigel for all cells tested and the effect was more pronounced for progenitor cells in comparison with mature cells. Co-culture of differentiated endothelial cells with progenitor cells showed that there was incorporation of EPCs in vessels formed by HUVECs and HUAECs. Cell migration was assessed using an in vitro wound healing model. The results of these experiments showed an inverse correlation between AA concentrations relative to both cell migration and gap filling capacity. Suppression of NO (nitric oxide) generation appeared to be one of the mechanisms by which AA mediated angiostatic effects. This study supports further investigation into non-cytotoxic antitumor activities of AA.},

	abstract = {Oxidative stress is thought to be one of the causes of impaired function of vascular endothelial cells, causing a variety of cardiovascular disorders. Studies in various animal experiments proved the aqueous extract of purple sweet potato tuber has antioxidant potential, through the mechanism of enhancement of endogenous antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), that protects endothelial cells from oxidative stress. Effect of aqueous extract of purple sweet potato tuber in  increasing SOD has not been proven in human vascular endothelial cells. This study aims to prove whether aqueous extract of purple sweet potato tuber may increase the expression of SOD-2 and SOD-3 in human vascular endothelium. This research was an experimental study on umbilical vein endothelial cells experiencing oxidative stress created by administering H2O2 in vitro, and protected with aqueous extract of purple sweet potato tuber at various concentrations. Observation of the SOD-2 and SOD-3 on endothelial cells was done by using immunohystochemestry with monoclonal antibodies. The results showed a significant (p {\textless} 0.05) increase  in SOD-2 and SOD-3 on endothelial protected with   aqueous extract of purple sweet potato tuber at concentration of 1.5625- 3.125 µg/ml for SOD-2 and at concentration of 1.5625- 25µg/ml for SOD-3. From these results it can be concluded that the aqueous extract of purple sweet potato tuber could protect endothelial cells from oxidative stress through increasing  expression of SOD-2 and SOD-3.

PRESENTATION OF CASE: We performed a literature review of this technique, highlighting the crucial role of lipofilling in breast cancer reconstruction. DISCUSSION: The efficacy of the fat graft transplantation depends on the experience and the technique used by the surgeon. The ASCs (adipose-derived stem cells) contained in the fat graft has proven to be crucial for breast reconstruction by mean the regeneration of tissue, through the chemotactic, paracrine, and immunomodulatory activities and their in situ differentiation. CONCLUSION: The role of lipofilling for breast reconstruction could be more significant with the application of the findings of experimental research on tissue engineering and ASCs.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most commonly occurring cancer worldwide, and the overall incidence is still rising. Unfortunately, the cancer registry in Poland does not record BCC individually. Thus, the incidence of BCC in a defined population is unknown. AIM: Analysis of incidence rates of primary BCC in central Poland during 16 years considering sex, site distribution and age to determine trends. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively included all cases of BCC which were diagnosed and treated in the Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Medical University of Lodz, during the 16-year period from 1999 to 2015. RESULTS: We recorded 945 BCCs occurring in 890 patients (504 females - 57\%, 386 males - 43\%). Patient's age was between 21 and 94. A distinct increase in BCC was observed after 1999, while after 2010 during the next 2-year period a slight decrease was noted. A statistically significant correlation was observed between histopathological types of BCC and the location of the lesions. The superficial type predominates on photoprotected areas, especially on the trunk, while the nodular type occurs mainly in facial areas. No statistically significant correlation was observed between histopathological types of BCC and sex. We found a significant increase in incidence for superficial BCC among middle-age patients, while the nodular type was observed more frequently among elderly subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Basal cell carcinoma is quite common in Poland and predominantly develops in the facial area. In middle-age patients the most common is superficial BCC, while in elderly people the nodular type is most common. Based on our results we assume that there is a strong need to educate general physicians to enable them to diagnose BCC in the early stages.},

	abstract = {Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and consists of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are the most common non-melanoma skin cancers. The ideal surgical treatment for BCC is complete removal, and it can be achieved either with safety margins or with micrographic control. The currently accepted treatment for basal cell carcinoma is an elliptical excision with a 4-mm surgical margin of clinically normal skin. However, because of cosmetic and functional constraints on the face, a 4-mm surgical margin is often not feasible. We used PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), and Google scholar as our main databases to search for the relevant published studies and used "Basal cell carcinoma" and "narrow excision margins" as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) keywords. Fifteen studies were finalized for the review, which included 3843 lesions. The size of the lesions ranged from 3 to 30 mm, with a mean size of 11.7 mm. Surgical margins varied from 1 to 5 mm. This review was done to evaluate if small, well-defined primary BCCs can be excised using narrow surgical margins. Based on the reviewed literature, we found that for primary well-demarcated BCCs smaller than 2 cm, in the low-risk group, a safety margin of 3 mm gives satisfactory results. In the high-risk group, and for lesions larger than 2 cm, a 4-6 mm margin is suggested for getting clear margins. Mohs micrographic surgery is advocated for more complex and recurrent lesions where the clinical margin is not apparent. However, micrographic surgery is not readily available in many places and requires more training and experience. Therefore, excision with 2 mm margins for clinically well-defined lesions with close follow-up can be followed to preserve the healthy tissue in anatomic constraint lesions and avoid the need for complex reconstructive procedures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The best way to approach surgically removed basal cell carcinoma with positive histopathological margins is a controversial issue. Some authors believe that the more appropriate treatment is an immediate reoperation while others prefer a periodic follow up. The rates of recurrence are variable in literature, between 10\% and 67\%. OBJECTIVE: To define the recurrence rate of basal cell carcinoma with positive margins after surgery. Secondarily, identify morphological aspects that can suggest a more frequent tumoral recurrence. METHODS: This was a retrospective and observational study made by analysis of medical records of 487 patients between January 2003 and December 2009 in Hospital de Clínicas da Universidade Federal do Paraná (HC-UFPR). From 402 basal cell carcinomas surgically treated, 41 fulfilled inclusion criteria and were evaluated for five years or more. Recurrence rate of these tumors was analyzed in all patients and clinical characteristics such as sex, age, tumor size, tumor site, ulceration, and histological type were evaluated in order to find if they were related to more common tumoral recurrence. RESULTS: The rate of positive margins after surgery was 12.18\%. There were five cases of tumoral recurrence in the observation group and three cases in the re-excision group. Tumor size, site, histological type, ulceration and type of positive margin did not differ statistically between groups. It was not possible to consider if these factors were important in recurrence rates. STUDY LIMITATIONS: Ideally, a prospective study with a larger sample would be more accurate. CONCLUSION: The treatment of choice in basal cell carcinoma with positive margins must be individualized to reduce recurrence rates.},

RECENT FINDINGS: The first step of nasal reconstruction is a thoughtful analysis of the defect. The best surgical option will provide the patient with an excellent esthetic result and nasal function. Depending upon the extent of the defect as well as the anatomic site, a local flap, full-thickness skin graft, composite graft, or interpolated flap will provide the optimal result. The decision will depend on the surgeon's experience and expertise, as well as expectations and desires of the patient. Many cutaneous defects will require not only reconstruction of the defect, but also cartilage grafts to provide nasal contour and support. Most large or complex defects will require a paramedian forehead flap for reconstruction along with cartilaginous and/or bony support, as well as a lining flap. SUMMARY: This study highlights recent advances in nasal reconstruction and novel modifications of well-accepted traditional techniques.},

	abstract = {Skin grafting in nasal reconstruction, long used by dermatologists, can provide superior results and can well be the "go to" procedure for nasal reconstruction. The upper two-thirds of the nose is composed of both flattened, featureless and often thin skin that is well recreated with defect-only full-thickness grafting. Skin grafting for the lower third of the nose has been practiced for years by dermatologists; over the last 4 to 5 years, it has been embraced by plastic surgeons. The patient and donor site selection is critical. Meticulous attention to graft selection, utilization of a no-touch technique during graft harvest and placement of surgical bolsters with through-and-through tacking sutures are essential to ensure 100\% graft take and a successful aesthetic result.},

The zone of inhibition as determined by agar well diffusion method varied with the plant extract, the solvent used for extraction, and the organism tested. Klebsiella pneumoniae 2, Escherichia coli 3 and Staphylococcus aureus 3 were resistant to the plant extracts tested. Moreover, water extracts did not restrain the growth of any tested bacteria. Ethanol and methanol extracts were found to be more potent being capable of exerting significant inhibitory activities against majority of the bacteria investigated. Staphylococcus aureus 1 was the most inhibited bacterial isolate with 24 extracts (60\%) inhibiting its growth whereas Escherichia coli 2 exhibited strong resistance being inhibited by only 11 extracts (28\%). The results obtained in the agar diffusion plates were in fair correlation with that obtained in the minimum inhibitory concentration tests. The minimum inhibitory concentration of tulsi, oregano, rosemary and aloe vera extracts was found in the range of 1.56-6.25 mg/ml for the multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates tested whereas higher values (6.25-25 mg/ml) were obtained against the multi-drug resistant isolates Klebsiella pneumoniae 1 and Escherichia coli 1 and 2. Qualitative phytochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of tannins and saponins in all plants tested. Thin layer chromatography and bioautography agar overlay assay of ethanol extracts of neem, tulsi and aloe vera indicated flavonoids and tannins as major active compounds against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.},

	abstract = {While infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were traditionally restricted to the hospital setting, novel MRSA strains emerged over the last two decades that have the capacity to infect otherwise healthy people outside of the hospital setting. These community-associated (CA-)MRSA strains combine methicillin resistance with enhanced virulence and fitness. Interestingly, CA-MRSA strains emerged globally and from different backgrounds, indicating that the "trade-off" between maintaining sufficient levels of methicillin resistance and obtaining enhanced virulence at a low fitness cost was achieved on several occasions in convergent evolution. However, frequently this process comprised similar changes. First and foremost, all CA-MRSA strains typically carry a novel type of methicillin resistance locus that appears to cause less of a fitness burden. Additionally, acquisition of specific toxin genes, most notably that encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), and adaptation of gene expression of genome-encoded toxins, such as alpha-toxin and phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs), further contributed to the evolution of CA-MRSA. Finally, the exceptional epidemiological success of the USA300 CA-MRSA clone in particular may have been due to yet another gene acquisition, namely that of the speG gene, which is located on the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) and involved in detoxifying harmful host-derived polyamines.},

The present review has been primed to describe the existing data on the information on botany, phytochemical constituents, traditional uses and pharmacological actions of S. cumini (L.) Skeels (jambolan). Electronic database search was conducted with the search terms of Eugenia jambolana, S. cumini, jambolan, common plum and java plum. The plant has been viewed as an antidiabetic plant since it became commercially available several decades ago. During last four decades, numerous folk medicine and scientific reports on the antidiabetic effects of this plant have been cited in the literature. The plant is rich in compounds containing anthocyanins, glucoside, ellagic acid, isoquercetin, kaemferol and myrecetin. The seeds are claimed to contain alkaloid, jambosine, and glycoside jambolin or antimellin, which halts the diastatic conversion of starch into sugar. The vast number of literatures found in the database revealed that the extracts of different parts of jambolan showed significant pharmacological actions. We suggest that there is a need for further investigation to isolate active principles which confer the pharmacological action. Hence identification of such active compounds is useful for producing safer drugs in the treatment of various ailments including diabetes.},
